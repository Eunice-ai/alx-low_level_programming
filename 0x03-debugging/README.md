# Tasks 0 Multiple mains
[`0-main.c, main.h`](0-main.c, main.h)

This main file is a test for a postitive or negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

# Tasks 1 Like, comment, subscribe
[`1-main.c`](1-main.c)

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

* Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code

# Tasks 2- 0 > 972
[`2-largest_number.c, main.h`](2-largest_number.c, main.h)

This program prints the largest of three integers.

# Tasks 3 Leap year
[`3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h`](3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h)

This program converts a date to the day of year and determines howmany days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
