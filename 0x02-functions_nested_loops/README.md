## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

# Tasks 0 - _putchar
[`0-putchar.c`](0-putchar)

Write a program that prints putchar, followed by a new line.
* The program should return 0

# Tasks 1-I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.
[`1-alphabet.c`](1-alphabet.c)

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print(_)alphabet(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

# Tasks 2 - 10 x alphabet
[`2-print_alphabet_x10.c`](2-print_alphabet_x10.c)

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

# Tasks 3 - islower
[`3-islower.c`](3-islower.c)

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* Prototype: int islower(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is lowercase
* Returns 0 otherwise

# Tasks 4 - isalpha
[`4-isalpha.c`](4-isalpha.c)

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
* Prototype: int isalpha(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
* Returns 0 otherwise

# Tasks 5 sign
[`5-sign.c`](5-sign.c)

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
* Prototype: int print sign(int n);
* Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
* Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
* Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

# Tasks 6 There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
[`6-abs.c`](6-abs.c)

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

# Tasks 7 There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
[`7-print_last_digit.c`](7-print_last_digit.c)

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* Prototype: int printlastdigit(int);
* Returns the value of the last digit

# Tasks 8 I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
[`8-24_hours.c`](8-24_hours.c)

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* Prototype: void jackbauer(void);
* You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)
